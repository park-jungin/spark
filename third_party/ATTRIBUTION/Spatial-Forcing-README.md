## 🌟 Key Features of Spatial-Forcing (SF)

1. **Universality**: SF is a **plug-and-play** 3D finetune strategy that can be seamlessly integrated with any VLA training process, requiring only **30 lines** of code modifications. It substantially enhances spatial reasoning and manipulation capabilities. We provide implementations based on **OpenVLA** and **Pi0**, along with a **quick-start guide** for adapting SF to other VLA models.

2. **Strong Performance**: SF achieves **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** results on both **LIBERO** and **RoboTwin** benchmarks.  
In real-world experiments involving complex spatial structures, SF improves task success rates by **up to 50%**.

3. **Efficient Training**: SF requires only **3% of the training steps** or **5% of the training data** to reach a 66% success rate on LIBERO-Long. Moreover, it achieves strong real-world performance with as few as **20 demonstrations**.


## 📃 Overview
![teaser](./figs/teaser.png)

Our Spatial-Forcing (SF) model aligns the intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. This alignment demonstrates enhanced performance, training efficiency, and data effificency.
